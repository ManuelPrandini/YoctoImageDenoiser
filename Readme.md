# YoctoImageDenoiser
For the final project of Computer Graphics Master Computer Science course, I implemented two kind of denoiser used to eliminate the sample noise generated on the images by MonteCarlo path tracing:
- An AI denoiser application exploiting Intel Open Image Denois;
- A Non Local Means denoiser application.

The project is based on the Yocto Library [https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl], and the denoiser applications are tested on images generated by the yocto_pathrace application.
Is possible to build the project using CMake with the script build.sh placed in the scripts folder.

## AI Denoiser
The AI denoiser application is based on Intel Open Image Denoise library [https://openimagedenoise.github.io/]. 
Intel Open Image Denoise is an open source library of high-performance, high-quality denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing. Intel Open Image Denoise is part of the IntelÂ® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit and is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.
This kind of denoiser support both the LDR images and HDR images. For better results, the ai denoiser can set also the filter for the Normal rendering images and Albedo rendering images. This helps preserving fine details and textures in the image.
This denoiser required few seconds of computation to obtain really good results.

You can use the application running the following command.
```sh
$ ./bin/yimage_intel_denoiser input_image [--alb albedo_image] [--nrm normal_image] [--hdr] [--filter RT|RTLightmap] [--srgb] [-o output_image]
```
where:
- input_image is the image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- alb with relative argument indicates the albedo_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- nrm with relative argument indicates the normal_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- --hdr indicates that we want to use the hdr filter;
- --filter indicates the filter type to use. By default is used 'RT' that indicates the MonteCarlo ray tracing but it is possible to use 'RTLightmap'. This is a variant of the RT filter optimized for denoising HDR lightmaps. It does not support LDR images. 
- --srgb whether the color is encoded with the sRGB (or 2.2 gamma) curve (LDR only) or is linear; the output will be encoded with the same curve. It is not possible to set this option with --hdr option.
- -o indicates the output path where save the result.

## Non Local Means Denoiser
The Non Local Means denoiser application is based on the NLM algorithm used to filter the images.
You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

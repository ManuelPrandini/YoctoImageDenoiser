# YoctoImageDenoiser
For the final project of Computer Graphics Master Computer Science course, I implemented two kind of denoiser used to eliminate the sample noise generated on the images by MonteCarlo path tracing:
- An AI denoiser application exploiting Intel Open Image Denoiser;
- A Non Local Means denoiser application.

The project is based on the Yocto-GL Library [https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl], and the denoiser applications are tested on images generated by the yocto_pathrace application. I did a little change on pathrace code, adding a function method to calculate the albedo on a input image. All the code written for the two denoiser is organized in functions that are inside the yocto_extension source file.
Is possible to build the project using CMake with the script build.sh placed in the scripts folder.

## AI Denoiser
The AI denoiser application is based on Intel Open Image Denoise library [https://openimagedenoise.github.io/]. 
Intel Open Image Denoise is an open source library of high-performance, high-quality denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing. Intel Open Image Denoise is part of the IntelÂ® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit and is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.
This kind of denoiser support both the LDR images and HDR images. For better results, the ai denoiser can set also the filter for the Normal rendering images and Albedo rendering images. This helps preserving fine details and textures in the image.
This denoiser required few seconds of computation to obtain really good results.

You can use the application yimage_intel_denoiser running the following command.
```sh
$ ./bin/yimage_intel_denoiser input_image [--alb albedo_image] [--nrm normal_image] [--hdr] [--filter RT|RTLightmap] [--srgb] [-o output_image]
```
where:
- input_image is the image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- alb with relative argument indicates the albedo_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- nrm with relative argument indicates the normal_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- --hdr indicates that we want to use the hdr filter;
- --filter indicates the filter type to use. By default is used 'RT' that indicates the MonteCarlo ray tracing but it is possible to use 'RTLightmap'. This is a variant of the RT filter optimized for denoising HDR lightmaps. It does not support LDR images. 
- --srgb whether the color is encoded with the sRGB (or 2.2 gamma) curve (LDR only) or is linear; the output will be encoded with the same curve. It is not possible to set this option with --hdr option.
- -o indicates the output path where save the result. It's possible to save both in LDR and HDR extension.

## Non Local Means Denoiser
The Non Local Means denoiser application is based on the NLM algorithm used to filter the images. 
I followed this paper [https://benedikt-bitterli.me/nfor/nfor.pdf] to implement the right weight formulas (also for the auxiliary weights like Albedo and Normal) to calculate the denoised pixels. For each image passed in input, I apply padding to keep patch and search windows of the same size for all pixels processed, even near the edges of the image. This application is  slower than AI denoiser but, using the classic weight formula, it takes approximately 2-3 minutes to generate an image.

 

You can use the application yimage_nlm_denoiser running the following command.
```sh
$ ./bin/yimage_nlm_denoiser input_image [--alb albedo_image] [--nrm normal_image] [-p dim_half_window_patch] [-s dim_half_window_search] [-h filter_param] [-a sigma] [-v] [-o output_image]
```
where:
- input_image is the image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- alb with relative argument indicates the albedo_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -- nrm with relative argument indicates the normal_image generated by the ray tracing algorithm. If the extension is .hdr the application load hdr image, otherwise simple .jpg image is used;
- -p indicates the half patch window side dimension. The entire window patch area is ((2 * dim_half_window_patch) + 1)^2;
- -s indicates the half search window side dimension. The entire window search area is ((2 * dim_half_window_search) + 1)^2; 
- -h is used to set a filter parameter value used in the weights formulas;
- -a is used to indicate how much noise is inside the image (This parameter should be calculated and not entered as input);
- -v is a boolean parameter to indicate if use the Rousselle et al. formula [https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/publications/AdaptiveRenderingNLM-SIGA12.pdf] to calculate the weights using also the pixel variance, instead of the classic formula that calculate the sum of the squared distances of the difference between the pixel to denoise and each pixel inside the search window minus two times the square of sigma parameter;
- -o indicates the output path where save the result. It's possible to save both in LDR and HDR extension.

N.B = the Rousselle et al formula, during the tests,  did not give me improvements but only worsened the execution time, so I leaved the classic weight formula for the tests.

## Comparison between two denoiser
I did several tests on images generated by the yscenetrace application, trying both hdr and ldr images with 1280 of resolution and different values of samples, in particular [64, 128, 512, 1024]. 
For example given these 3 input : 
### Example of 64 samples ldr -- input --
![bathroom path tracing](./tests/images/ldr/11_bathroom1/11_bathroom1_1280_64.jpg)
### Example of 64 samples ldr -- albedo --
![bathroom albedo](./tests/images/ldr/11_bathroom1/11_bathroom1_albedo_1280_64.jpg)
### Example of 64 samples ldr -- normal --
![bathroom normal](./tests/images/ldr/11_bathroom1/11_bathroom1_normal_1280_64.jpg)

The output produced by the two denoiser are the follow:
### Output of Intel ldr
![bathroom Intel](./out/ldr/intel/11_bathroom1_1280_64.jpg)
### Output of NLM ldr
![bathroom NLM](./out/ldr/nlm/11_bathroom1_1280_64.jpg)
